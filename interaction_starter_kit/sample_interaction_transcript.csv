00:00.00,00:03.80,A,"Hey, thanks for meeting—how’s your day going?"
00:03.80,00:07.10,B,Pretty good! I sprinted to make it here on time.
00:07.00,00:09.40,A,You ran? I appreciate the effort.
00:09.30,00:14.90,B,"Well, the bus was late and I didn’t want to cancel again."
00:14.90,00:20.00,A,Totally fair. Want water or coffee before we dive in?
00:20.00,00:22.80,B,"Water’s great, thanks."
00:22.70,00:28.60,A,"So—quick agenda: weekend plans, travel stories, then food talk."
00:28.50,00:33.80,B,I like a plan. Weekend first!
00:33.60,00:40.20,A,I’m thinking a small hike near the river. Too ambitious?
00:40.10,00:45.90,B,Not at all. I’ve been craving sunshine.
00:45.70,00:51.30,A,Same. Also I brought sunscreen last time and felt very prepared.
00:51.20,00:55.00,B,Extremely responsible.
00:54.90,01:00.50,A,I try. What’s your favorite nearby trail?
01:00.50,01:06.20,B,There’s one with quiet switchbacks and a tiny waterfall.
01:06.10,01:11.80,A,Sold. If it’s muddy we can pivot to the arboretum.
01:11.70,01:16.00,B,Deal. And after—
01:15.80,01:20.50,A,—snacks. Obviously.
01:20.40,01:25.90,B,"Yes, obviously. Chips are a moral imperative."
01:25.70,01:32.80,A,"Okay, travel stories. Best trip, worst trip—go!"
01:32.70,01:39.90,B,"Best: Lisbon. Tiny alleyways, sunsets on rooftops."
01:39.70,01:45.80,A,Rooftop sunsets are undefeated. Worst?
01:45.60,01:53.20,B,A red-eye with a snoring chorus. I did not sleep.
01:53.10,02:00.00,A,Oof. I once camped beside very confident raccoons.
01:59.80,02:05.50,B,Confident?
02:05.30,02:11.80,A,They negotiated for my trail mix with eye contact.
02:11.60,02:19.40,B,That’s bold. Did you surrender?
02:19.20,02:25.80,A,I offered peanuts as a truce.
02:25.60,02:31.20,B,Diplomacy wins again.
02:31.00,02:34.00,A,Rapid-fire round?
02:33.90,02:39.00,B,Ready. Favorite comfort food?
02:38.80,02:43.00,A,Spicy ramen. You?
02:42.90,02:47.90,B,Tomato soup with grilled cheese.
02:47.70,02:52.20,A,Rainy-day classic.
02:52.00,02:58.50,B,Okay: music you work to?
02:58.40,03:03.00,A,Lo-fi beats or film scores.
03:02.90,03:08.60,B,Same! Also ambient piano when I need focus.
03:08.40,03:14.90,A,Question—
03:14.60,03:19.20,B,—Yes?
03:19.10,03:26.00,A,What’s something you learned recently that surprised you?
03:25.80,03:34.20,B,That octopuses have distributed neurons in their arms; it changes how they explore.
03:34.00,03:40.10,A,That’s fascinating. Feels like parallel processing.
03:40.00,03:46.00,B,Exactly. Also: I learned to poach eggs properly.
03:45.80,03:51.60,A,Life skills tier list: high.
03:51.40,03:58.90,B,You should try adding a splash of vinegar.
03:58.70,04:04.00,A,Noted. Chef-approved.
04:03.90,04:10.50,B,I felt proud finishing a 10K last month.
04:10.40,04:16.00,A,Congrats! Training discipline shows.
04:15.90,04:23.50,B,Thanks. I did hit a wall at kilometer seven.
04:23.30,04:29.90,A,That’s where cheering helps. Or gummy bears.
04:29.70,04:36.50,B,Cheering and gummy bears: elite combo.
04:36.30,04:41.50,A,Pineapple on pizza works for me.
04:41.40,04:46.70,B,Respectfully disagree—
04:46.50,04:52.20,A,Fair! Variety keeps menus interesting.
04:52.00,04:57.50,B,Agreed. We can split half-and-half.
04:57.30,05:00.00,A,Deal. This was fun—let’s plan that hike.
