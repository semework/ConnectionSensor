Sample 5-Minute Interaction — Shot List (Full-Color, Neutral, Human-Centered)

Scene setup:
- Location: quiet café, daylight. Two people at a small round table.
- Cameras: A-cam (medium two-shot), B-cam (tight on Speaker A), C-cam (tight on Speaker B).
- Audio: two lav mics + room tone capture.

Beats:
0:00–0:30  Establishing two-shot; light ambient noise; A greets B.
0:30–1:30  Alternating singles; capture smiles, nods; no dramatic push-ins.
1:30–2:30  Faster cutting; capture brief overlap; include hand gestures on table.
2:30–3:30  Insert shots: water glasses, trail map on phone, casual laughs; maintain neutral tone.
3:30–4:30  Balanced singles; small disagreement then repair; keep framing steady, avoid caricature.
4:30–5:00  Two-shot rejoin; mutual acknowledgment; plan next-step; end on natural pause.

Coverage notes:
- Keep color natural (sRGB), avoid heavy grading. Maintain skin-tone accuracy.
- Light from window at ~45°; fill cards reduce contrast; no glam lighting.
- Respectful distance; no “reaction zooms.”
